    "content": "Couldn't fall asleep until almost 3am again. My chest felt tight all evening after that comment from my manager. I keep replaying it in my head. I know it probably wasn't a big deal but my body reacts like it's a crisis. I feel restless and on edge. I skipped dinner because I just didn't feel hungry.",
    "raw": "**Clinical Impression:**\n\nThe patient's diary entry raises some concern for potential underlying anxiety or stress-related symptoms, but does not strongly suggest a primary depressive disorder at this time.\n\n**Supporting Sentences:**\n\n*   \"My chest felt tight all evening after that comment from my manager.\" - This indicates a physical symptom (chest tightness) linked to a specific stressor (manager's comment), suggesting a physiological response to stress.\n*   \"I keep replaying it in my head.\" - This describes rumination, a common symptom often associated with anxiety and stress, rather than the pervasive low mood characteristic of depression.\n*   \"I feel restless and on edge.\" - These are classic symptoms of anxiety.\n*   \"I skipped dinner because I just didn't feel hungry.\" - While appetite changes can occur in depression, the patient attributes this to feeling \"on edge\" and \"restless,\" suggesting anxiety is a more likely primary driver than a core depressive symptom.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe patient exhibits symptoms like chest tightness, rumination, restlessness, and feeling on edge, which are more indicative of anxiety or stress responses. While appetite changes can occur in depression, the context provided points towards anxiety as a more prominent factor in this specific episode. Further assessment is warranted to differentiate between anxiety, stress, and potential depressive symptoms."
